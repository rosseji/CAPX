# CAPX
Cytometry analysis pipeline for large and complex datasets (CAPX).


# Five scripts used in the CAPX pipeline
CAPX-1-preprocessing  # pre-processing of data to prepare it for clustering and dimensionality reduction

CAPX-2-clustering     # clustering of data using FlowSOM and visualisation using tSNE, with differnetial downsampling options

CAPX-3-exploration    # explorationg of expression of each marker on each cluster, addition of a population name

CAPX-4-analysis       # summary tables for sample MFI and cell frequencies, plotted on heatmaps

CAPX-5-autograph      # automated generation of dot graphs (like bar graphs) for group comparisons and statistical analysis
